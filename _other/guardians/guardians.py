# A simple platform game is organized as a network of underground tunnels that intersect. 
# At each intersection, there are guardian robots that need to be overcome in order to 
# continue moving forward. Each tunnel is of the same length, and it takes the same 
# amount of time to overcome each guardian. At the beginning of the game, two players 
# are located at different intersections and want to join forces to overcome the guardians 
# more easily. Both players move at the same speed through the tunnels. Write a function named 
# 'join(map, intersection1, intersection2)' in the Python programming language that uses a 
# search algorithm to determine, based on the initial intersections of both players 
# (intersection1 and intersection2), the minimum number of guardians they need to overcome
# in order to join at one of the intersections in the game defined by the graph map." 
# Loops are forbidden! Only recursion! 

def join(map, intersection1, intersection2, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()  # Initialize the set of visited intersections

    # Base case: If the players are already at the same intersection, no guardians need to be overcome
