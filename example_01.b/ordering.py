# Define function 'ordering', which combines 2 lists of numbers into one list consisting of tuple objects that have three elements. 
# The first element of the resulting collection is an element of the first list, the second is an element of the 
# second list, and the third is either 'Yes' if the second list element is twice as large as the first list element,

# data of the resulting collection consists of the nth numbers from both input lists, where the smaller and larger
