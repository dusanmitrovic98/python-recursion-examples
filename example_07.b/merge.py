# Create a function named 'merge' that takes a list of tuple objects and creates a dictionary. The first element of each tuple object becomes the key of the dictionary,
# while all other values become the value (list of values).
# If the tuple has fewer than 2 values, replace the missing values with None. If the key already exists in the dictionary, overwrite its value with the new one.
# It is forbidden to use loops (except in comprehension syntax).
# Example: merge([(1), (3, 4, 5), (7), (1, 4, 5), (6, 2, 1, 3)]) = { 1: [4, 5], 3: [4, 5], 7: None, 6: [2, 1, 3] }

# todo implement
def merge(list):
    return

# print(merge([(1), (3, 4, 5), (7), (1, 4, 5), (6, 2, 1, 3)]))
